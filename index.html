        <h1>Hi my name is Muthoni and I love tech.</h1>
        <p>I know finding love while your older isn't easy but after kissing a few frogs(Sales and Marketing) I finally found my prince charming (Software Engineering).</p>
        <p>I'm quick to brag about my new found interest as everyday learning and researching I feel more and more fullfilled. It was trully a missing piece in my life and I can finally say I found my purpose, being able to build and design is just what I needed. I strive to <strong> LEARN more to better my craft.</strong></p>
